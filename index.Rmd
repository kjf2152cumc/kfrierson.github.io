Hi there! I am a second year MPH student in Epidemiology at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology). I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biology from [SUNY Cortland](https://www2.cortland.edu/departments/biology/) and am licensed by the New York Health Department as an Advanced EMT. Throughout my undergraduate education, I worked in the [DÃ¡valos lab](https://www2.cortland.edu/departments/biology/faculty/davalos.dot) investigating the individual and cumulative effects of multiple ecological stressors in forests of the Northeast. Now I am putting my public health education and research skills to work while developing a Master's Thesis with [Dr. Zachary Mannes](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/zachary-l-mannes-phd#:~:text=Zachary%20Mannes%20is%20an%20Assistant,the%20Yale%20School%20of%20Medicine.). Alongside Dr. Mannes, an emergency care epidemiologist, I hope to characterize the prehospital needs of geriatric patients across NY. In May 2025, I will graduate from Columbia and plan to attend medical school the following fall. Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, hiking, bird watching, reading, and collecting books.
