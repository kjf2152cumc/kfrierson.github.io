Hi there! I am a recent graduate of the MPH program in Epidemiology at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology). I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Biology from [SUNY Cortland](https://www2.cortland.edu/departments/biology/) and am licensed by the New York Health Department as an Advanced EMT. Throughout my undergraduate education, I worked in the [DÃ¡valos lab](https://www2.cortland.edu/departments/biology/faculty/davalos.dot) investigating the individual and cumulative effects of multiple ecological stressors in forests of the Northeast. 

<br>

My Master's Thesis, supervised by [Dr. Zachary Mannes](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/zachary-l-mannes-phd#:~:text=Zachary%20Mannes%20is%20an%20Assistant,the%20Yale%20School%20of%20Medicine.), sought to explore associations between place-based social vulnerability and prehospital encounters among older adults. This summer I will be matriculating to medical school with the long-term goal of working as a physician-scientist. Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, hiking, bird watching, reading, and collecting books.
